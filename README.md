# Zyfra Gold Mining Data Science Project

The Task:

I am a Data Scientist for Zyfra. Zyfra is a company that develops and implements digital solutions for the industrial sector.

My task is to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. 
    
    - I have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.


In this project, I will be testing my skills on all aspects of Data Science by:
    
- Preprocessing multiple datasets
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
- Creating multiple machine learning models and measuring performance.
- Tune hyperparameters to produce the best model
- Create a function for the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error metric and using that to judge my final model.

The overall goal of this project is to display all I've learned regarding data analysis, machine learning, and hyperparamter tuning to create the best possible model for the client.

I use the sklearn library with several modules as well as the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
